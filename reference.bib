  abstract = {Inference using deep neural networks is often outsourced to the cloud since it is a computationally demanding task. However, this raises a fundamental issue of trust. How can a client be sure that the cloud has performed inference correctly? A lazy cloud provider might use a simpler but less accurate model to reduce its own computational load, or worse, maliciously modify the inference results sent to the client. We propose SafetyNets, a framework that enables an untrusted server (the cloud) to provide a client with a short mathematical proof of the correctness of inference tasks that they perform on behalf of the client. Specifically, SafetyNets develops and implements a specialized interactive proof (IP) protocol for verifiable execution of a class of deep neural networks, i.e., those that can be represented as arithmetic circuits. Our empirical results on three- and four-layer deep neural networks demonstrate the run-time costs of SafetyNets for both the client and server are low. SafetyNets detects any incorrect computations of the neural network by the untrusted server with high probability, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST digit recognition (99.4\%) and TIMIT speech recognition tasks (75.22\%).},

  title = {{zkCNN}: Zero Knowledge Proofs for Convolutional Neural Network Predictions and Accuracy},
  year = {2021},
  isbn = {9781450384544},
  abstract = {Deep learning techniques with neural networks are developing prominently in recent years and have been deployed in numerous applications. Despite their great success, in many scenarios it is important for the users to validate that the inferences are truly computed by legitimate neural networks with high accuracy, which is referred to as the integrity of machine learning predictions. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose zkCNN, a zero knowledge proof scheme for convolutional neural networks (CNN). The scheme allows the owner of the CNN model to prove to others that the prediction of a data sample is indeed calculated by the model, without leaking any information about the model itself. Our scheme can also be generalized to prove the accuracy of a secret CNN model on a public dataset.Underlying zkCNN is a new sumcheck protocol for proving fast Fourier transforms and convolutions with a linear prover time, which is even faster than computing the result asymptotically. We also introduce several improvements and generalizations on the interactive proofs for CNN predictions, including verifying the convolutional layer, the activation function of ReLU and the max pooling. Our scheme is highly efficient in practice. It can support the large CNN of VGG16 with 15 million parameters and 16 layers. It only takes 88.3 seconds to generate the proof, which is 1264\texttimes{} faster than existing schemes. The proof size is 341 kilobytes, and the verifier time is only 59.3 milliseconds. Our scheme can further scale to prove the accuracy of the same CNN on 20 images.},

  pages={164047-164059},
  abstract={Many applications have recently adopted machine learning and deep learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are made up of sequential operations including activation, pooling, convolution, and fully connected layer, and their computation cost is enormous, with convolution and fully connected layer dominating. In general, a user with insufficient computer capacity delegated certain tasks to a server with sufficient computing power, and the user may want to verify that the outputs are truly machine learning model predictions. In this paper, we are interested in verifying that the delegation of CNNs, one of the deep learning models for image recognition and classification, is correct. Specifically, we focus on the verifiable computation of matrix multiplications in a CNN convolutional layer. We use Thaler’s idea (CRYPTO 2013) for validating matrix multiplication operations and present a predicate function based on the insight that the sequence of operations can be viewed as sequential matrix multiplication. Furthermore, we lower the cost of proving by splitting a convolution operation into two halves. As a result, we can provide an efficient sum-check protocol for a convolution operation that, like the state-of-the-art zkCNN (ePrint 2021) approach, achieves asymptotically optimal proving cost. The suggested protocol is about  $2\times $  cheaper than zkCNN in terms of communication costs. We also propose a verified inference system based on our method as the fundamental building component.},
